### Gâ€™day, Iâ€™m Josh Salway ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a developer from the Gold Coast, Australia. I focus on creating practical applications that solve real-world problems, with experience in Laravel and full-stack development.  

Outside of work, Iâ€™m into gaming, cycling, and working on tech-driven side projects. Iâ€™m always up for learning new things and taking on challenges.
